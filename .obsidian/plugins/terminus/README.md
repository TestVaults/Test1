# Terminus

A real terminal inside Obsidian that never lets you lose the thread on what [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) just did. You type `claude` (or anything else) exactly like you would in any other terminal — nothing is wrapped or intercepted — and Claude keeps working through a whole multi-file turn uninterrupted. Two things happen because of that:

- **A command fails, and you don't leave the terminal to deal with it.** A small badge appears right next to the failed command. Click it and Claude explains what happened and proposes a fix, using the surrounding command history for context — no copying an error into a separate chat window and pasting the context back and forth by hand.
- **Claude finishes editing, and nothing is a mystery.** Every file it touched shows up in one Pending Changes panel — what changed, where, and by how much — with a real line-numbered diff per file and Accept / Reject / Edit right there. No more hunting for "where did that change happen"; even editor plugins built specifically for opening code in Obsidian don't show you a diff, and Terminus does.

Edits land on disk immediately; you review what changed afterwards, with the option to revert.

## Features

### Terminal

- **A real PTY-backed terminal** — full interactive shell (zsh/bash), not a fake console. Run anything, not just `claude`.
- **Multiple concurrent terminals** — open as many as you want; each is independently labeled ("Terminus 1", "Terminus 2", ...) and runs its own session.
- **Choose where a new terminal opens** — clicking the ribbon icon (or running "Open Terminus") shows a quick menu: new tab, split right, split down, or new window. Set a fixed default in Settings to skip the menu entirely.
- **Adjustable font size** — a settings slider, plus `Cmd/Ctrl+=` / `Cmd/Ctrl+-` / `Cmd/Ctrl+0` to zoom in/out/reset live.
- **Scrollback persistence** — closing and reopening Obsidian restores what was on screen, clearly marked as a previous session.

### Claude Code review workflow

- **Non-blocking by design** — a `PreToolUse` hook records the pre-edit snapshot of every file Claude touches, but never blocks the write. Claude finishes its whole turn; you review afterward.
- **Pending Changes panel** — a persistent sidebar panel, grouped by terminal (each group collapsible independently), showing every file changed with a line-numbered, word-level diff and a scroll minimap. Colors follow your vault's accent color rather than a fixed theme.
- **Comes to front automatically** — once Claude finishes a burst of edits, the panel reveals itself (debounced across a whole multi-file turn, so it doesn't interrupt mid-turn or pop up once per file). Toggleable in Settings, with an adjustable delay.
- **Accept / Reject, per file or in bulk** — Accept is a no-op (the file's already correct); Reject reverts to the exact pre-edit content (or deletes the file, if it was newly created). A global "Reject all" / "Keep all" covers everything; each terminal group also gets its own scoped (visually secondary) versions. Optionally require a confirmation before any bulk action (off by default — every one is already reversible via "Recently resolved").
- **Edits coalesce within a turn** — multiple edits to the same file in one turn merge into a single row with one true revert point, instead of several overlapping ones.
- **Undo, even after Accept** — a "Recently resolved" list lets you reverse either outcome after the fact.
- **Persistent, searchable action log** — a lightweight on-disk history (filename, stats, outcome) that survives Obsidian restarts, independent of the short in-memory undo list.
- **Rendered markdown preview** — toggle a pending change's diff view to see the note as it will actually render, not just raw markdown text.
- **Git-aware baseline** — for a vault under version control, an extra "vs git HEAD" diff view alongside the since-last-edit one (purely informational).
- **Backlink-breakage warnings** — flags when an edit removes a heading or block that other notes reference via `[[Note#Heading]]` or `[[Note#^block]]`.
- **Inline in-editor diff** — click "Open" on a pending change to see the diff directly in the real note, with Accept/Reject controls right there.
- **Split Diff view — per-hunk Accept/Reject** — click "Split Diff" on a pending change for a dedicated side-by-side (old | new) view with its own Accept/Reject bar on every individual changed block, so you can keep some edits and revert others within the same file instead of an all-or-nothing per-file decision. Not available for `NotebookEdit` changes, since their diff is a display-only approximation of the real file content and can't be safely spliced.
- **Keyboard-driven review** — accept/reject the oldest pending change without touching the panel.

### Terminal help for beginners

- **Shell integration** (zsh and bash) tracks every command's boundaries and exit code, without modifying your actual `.zshrc`/`.bashrc`.
- **Failure badges** — a small ⚠ appears next to any command that exits non-zero.
- **Explain this** — click the badge for a plain-English explanation of what happened, from an isolated `claude -p` call with no file/tool access. Its result has a fixed spot above the action buttons and stays there regardless of what else you do in the popup. Both this and Suggest a fix see not just the failed command but a few commands run right before it too, so a failure that's really about an earlier step (e.g. a `git push` failing because nothing was committed yet) gets diagnosed with that context, not just the last line.
- **Suggest a fix** — asks Claude for its single best corrective command with a one-sentence rationale, shown below the action buttons with its own Apply/Cancel. Apply types it into your terminal's input line, unexecuted — you review, edit, or press Enter yourself. Clicking "Suggest a fix" again gets the next-best option instead of repeating itself. Claude never runs anything on its own here.

## How it works

**Review workflow.** The plugin auto-provisions a project-scoped `.claude/settings.local.json` in your vault wiring a `PreToolUse` hook (matching `Edit|Write|NotebookEdit`) to a bundled script. That script POSTs the tool call to a local, loopback-only HTTP server the plugin runs, which records the file's current content (before the write happens) and lets the hook return immediately — Claude is never blocked. Rejecting a change later writes that recorded content back to disk.

**Terminal.** There's no native-addon PTY dependency (no `node-pty`, no Electron-ABI rebuild headaches). A small bundled Python script (`resources/pty_helper.py`) allocates a real pseudo-terminal via Python's stdlib and proxies bytes between the PTY and its own stdio; the plugin talks to it with a plain `child_process.spawn`. The terminal UI is `xterm.js`.

**Shell integration.** Two tiny rc scripts (`resources/shell-integration/{zsh,bash}/`) get sourced by redirecting `ZDOTDIR` (zsh) or `HOME` (bash) for the *spawned shell only* — never the plugin's own Python helper process — restoring the real value immediately and chain-loading your actual `.zshrc`/`.bash_profile` before adding invisible `OSC 133` markers around each command. Nothing on disk is modified.

**Command help.** "Explain this" and "Suggest a fix" are standalone `claude -p` calls with `--allowedTools ""` — no file or shell access, pure Q&A — independent of whatever's running in any terminal, so they work even if no terminal has `claude` open at all.

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux (Windows isn't supported — shell integration and the PTY helper are Unix-specific).
- Python 3.9+ (`pty_helper.py` uses `os.waitstatus_to_exitcode`, added in 3.9) and the [`claude` CLI](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) installed and logged in. Both are auto-detected (including a login-shell `PATH` lookup, since Obsidian launched from Finder/Dock often inherits a minimal one); if detection ever picks the wrong binary, Settings has manual overrides for the shell and Python 3 paths.
- `git` is optional, only needed for the "vs git HEAD" diff view.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev    # unminified build with inline sourcemaps
npm run build  # typecheck + minified production build
```

The build bundles `src/main.ts` into `main.js` with esbuild, and regenerates `styles.css` from `src/css/custom.css` plus xterm.js's own stylesheet. Copy (or symlink) the plugin folder into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/terminus/` and enable it in **Settings → Community plugins**.
